# Libsync

A self-hosted web UI for managing and downloading your Qobuz and Tidal music libraries.

Runs as a small FastAPI + SvelteKit server in Docker (or locally) and is accessed through any browser. It syncs your streaming-service favorites into a local database, lets you search and trigger downloads with live progress, and organizes the files on disk with your preferred folder/track templates. Both Qobuz and Tidal go through standalone async Python SDKs (consumed as a git submodule) — no CLI, no TOML config, no hidden state.

> Libsync started life as a fork of [nathom/streamrip](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip) and was rebuilt around a web UI. The original `rip` CLI, the TUI, and the Deezer/SoundCloud source clients are no longer part of this project. See [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) for credit to the upstream. Some internals (env var names, the on-disk SQLite filename, the `.streamrip.json` sentinel) still carry the old name to preserve compatibility with existing deployments — those will rename in a future major release.

## Features

- **Library browsing** — every album you've favorited in Qobuz or Tidal, with cover art, sortable table, and search
- **Album detail** — full track list, bit-depth / sample-rate / codec info, per-track download status
- **Search** — queries the streaming services directly; results show whether each album is already in your library
- **Downloads** — queue albums from the library or search, with real-time per-track progress pushed over WebSocket
- **Playlists** — browse Qobuz playlists and queue all referenced albums from a playlist detail panel
- **Sync** — manual refresh or scheduled auto-sync to keep local library in step with the streaming service
- **Custom paths** — folder/track format templates with live preview in Settings (`{albumartist}`, `{title}`, `{container}`, `{bit_depth}`, `{sampling_rate}`, etc.)
- **Filesystem dedup** — a `.streamrip.json` sentinel file per album folder so re-scans and reset-database operations don't re-download work you already have
- **Library scan** — fuzzy-matches pre-existing local collections against your synced library (bit-depth-aware, read-only-mount friendly) with a review UI for ambiguous cases and a manual **Mark as downloaded** button on album pages
- **Artwork embedding** — cover art baked into tags at configurable resolution
- **OAuth login** for Qobuz and Tidal (browser/device flows, including a headless URL-paste flow for Qobuz)
- **Per-source dedup database** so Qobuz and Tidal track IDs never collide

## Requirements

- **Docker** (recommended) — everything runs inside the image, you just need a folder to mount for music and a volume for the SQLite data
- **or** Python 3.10+, Node 20+, `poetry`, `ffmpeg`, and access to [`arthursoares/qobuz_tidal_api_client`](https://github.com/arthursoares/qobuz_tidal_api_client) for the SDK submodule

A **premium Qobuz or Tidal subscription** is required for downloads. This project doesn't bypass DRM or account restrictions — it uses your own credentials against the streaming services' own APIs.

## Quick start — Docker

```bash
# clone with submodules so the Qobuz + Tidal SDKs come along
git clone --recursive git@github.com:arthursoares/libsync.git
cd libsync

# build
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t libsync .

# run — mount your music folder and a data volume for the SQLite DB
# (env var and volume names retain the legacy `streamrip` prefix for
# now to keep existing installations working — see top-of-README note)
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ~/Music:/music \
  -v streamrip-data:/data \
  -e STREAMRIP_DB_PATH=/data/streamrip.db \
  libsync
```

Open http://localhost:8080 and follow the first-time setup below.

If you forgot `--recursive`, you can initialize the submodule after the fact:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Using Docker Compose

Prefer compose? A ready-to-use file is at [`docker-compose.example.yml`](docker-compose.example.yml). It pulls the published image from GHCR — no clone, no local build:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthursoares/libsync/main/docker-compose.example.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d
```

Config, credentials, and the library database land in `./data` next to the compose file — back that directory up to preserve your setup. Downloaded music goes to `./music`; edit the volume mapping if you want it elsewhere.

The `:latest` tag tracks stable releases. Swap to `:main` or `:dev` if you want rolling branch builds.

The container runs as a fixed non-root user (uid/gid `1000`), so the host directories you mount to `/music` and `/data` must be writable by that uid — run `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./music ./data` (or the paths you mounted) if they're currently owned by another user, e.g. `root` from before this change or from a fresh `mkdir`.

When upgrading an existing installation, stop the app and back up its data first. If `/data` uses a named volume (such as `streamrip-data` in the Docker quick start), changing `./data` on the host does not change that volume. Repair its ownership separately:

```bash
docker run --rm --user 0 --entrypoint chown \
  -v YOUR_DATA_VOLUME:/data \
  ghcr.io/arthursoares/libsync:latest -R 1000:1000 /data
```

Replace `YOUR_DATA_VOLUME` with the actual volume name from `docker volume ls`; Compose may prefix it with the project name. Ensure the music mount and any custom download paths are writable by UID 1000 as well, then restart the app. New empty named volumes inherit the correct ownership automatically. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for version-specific upgrade notes.

## Quick start — local dev

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:arthursoares/libsync.git
cd libsync

# install backend deps + both SDKs from the submodule
make deps
poetry install

# install frontend deps
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# build frontend + run backend with hot-reload on :8080
make dev
```

Separate targets if you want more control:

- `make dev-backend` — backend only, assumes `backend/static/` already has a built frontend
- `make dev-frontend` — frontend only with Vite hot-reload, proxied to a running backend
- `make test` — unit tests (no credentials needed; ~1s)
- `make lint` — ruff check on `backend/`
- `cd frontend && npm run check` — Svelte typecheck / diagnostics
- `node --test frontend/tests/*.test.js` — lightweight frontend logic tests
- `make docker` — build and run the Docker image

## First-time setup

1. Open http://localhost:8080 → **Settings**.
2. **Qobuz** — click **Login with Browser** to run the OAuth flow. On a remote/headless host, use **Headless Login** instead: run the flow on a machine with a browser, copy the redirect URL, paste it into the box.
3. **Tidal** — click **Connect Tidal** to start the device-code OAuth flow. The Settings page opens the approval URL and polls automatically until authorization completes.
4. Set **Download Path** to `/music` (Docker) or your preferred local path.
5. Choose your **Qobuz Quality** tier and adjust folder / track format templates if needed. The Settings page has a live preview.
6. Optional: use **Scan Downloads** to reconcile any existing music collection on disk with the library. Fuzzy-matches `Artist/Album/` folders by tags + bit-depth, auto-marks exact matches, and surfaces ambiguous cases for manual confirmation. For read-only mounts (NFS/SMB), turn **Write sentinel file** off before running.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Go to **Library** → **Refresh Library** to pull in your favorites.

## Architecture (one-paragraph version)

`backend/` is a FastAPI app serving both a REST API and a WebSocket channel. `frontend/` is a SvelteKit app compiled to static HTML/CSS/JS and served by the backend. State lives in a single SQLite database (`backend/models/database.py`) — albums, tracks, config, sync history. Streaming-service access goes through [`arthursoares/qobuz_tidal_api_client`](https://github.com/arthursoares/qobuz_tidal_api_client), consumed as a git submodule at `sdks/qobuz_api_client/`, which provides two separate Python packages: `qobuz` and `tidal`. Each exposes an `AlbumDownloader` with progress callbacks that the backend wires to WebSocket events. There is no CLI, no TOML config file, no hidden process — everything the app does is controlled from the Settings page and persisted in the SQLite DB.

For more detail see [`docs/WEB_UI.md`](docs/WEB_UI.md), [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md), and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Acknowledgements

The original [`nathom/streamrip`](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip) — this fork started from there and inherited the Qobuz/Tidal client logic, the tagging helpers, and the MQA decryption primitives. Most of that code now lives in the standalone `qobuz_tidal_api_client` SDK, but the design and much of the hard-won protocol knowledge came from upstream.
