"""Tests for DownloadService.

Test Plan: DownloadService

Scenario: Enqueue albums adds items to queue with pending status
  Given a database with a known album
  When enqueue is called with that album's source ID
  Then the returned item has the correct source_album_id and status "pending"

Scenario: Get queue returns all enqueued items
  Given a database with two albums
  When both are enqueued
  Then get_queue returns a list of length 2

Scenario: Cancel marks a pending item as cancelled
  Given a service with one pending item in the queue
  When cancel is called with that item's ID
  Then the item's status is "cancelled"
